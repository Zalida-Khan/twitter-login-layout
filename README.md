## Description
- The Twitter login page was created using next.js.
- I started by changing the favicon.co to the Twitter logo.
- I started working on the index.js page since it was the only one.
- I imported styles from other folders into the main page.
- I also created a components folder, in the public folder I created the images folder for any images that would be used in the project.
- I later did the stylizing of the buttons, text, input field, container/box, hover effects to buttons, Logo, etc.
- Toward the end, I added the breaking points for different devices such as the desktop, tablet (iPad Air), and iPhone XR.
